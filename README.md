# JSBoiler
## An attempt at making a JavaScript interpreter

- Planning only strict mode
- Not planning to implement `var`
- I don't know

### TODO
- All kinds of binary operators
  - Arithmetic, logical and assignment work
- Unary operators
- Ternary operator
- Functions
- ~~Objects~~
- Arrays
- Standard library
- Various other stuff
- ~~**Cabal**ize~~
- ~~Setup testing~~
  - more tests will always be good
- Maybe Optimisations

### Building

You will need the `stack` tool.
It is **extremely** hard to build the project:

```shell
stack build
```

Running tests:

```shell
stack test
```
